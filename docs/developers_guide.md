## 1. Intro and overview
As we know, REDCap provides rich features for designing, storing, and managing data entry records. However, what happens if there is a need to storage and manage non-record data?

There are known workarounds for this problem, such as creating a dedicated project for internal storage, using External Modules settings, adding extra rows to `redcap_metadata` table, inserting entries into REDCap logs table, etc. Despite all these are valid solutions, they bring design limitations and require an extra care to keep REDCap built-in tables safe and consistent.

Since UF CTSI team has been facing this challenge repeatedly, we have decided to build REDCap Entity - a framework for desiging and creating custom data structures, which represent new "entities" in the system. It's flexible because you can define properties - and safe, since CRUD operations are fully isolated from REDCap core's database tables.

Maybe the most attracting tool provided by this module is the Entity List Builder, which can be used to build simple lists or even complex admin UIs. It includes pager, exposed filters, add/edit/delete operations, sortable table columns, and bulk operations. They can be integrated either on your project and on Control Center. One working hour is quite enough to produce a result like this:

Our team is successfully using REDCap Entity to develop a few projects, such as Project Ownership and OnCore Client.

### How it works
This module is a developer's tool, so in order to design entity types, you need to create a new module that contains a hook (which defines the structure) and a less-than-10-line plugin (to render the list). For complex customizations, the built-in classes can be extended.

### Storage
The entities are stored into db tables prefixed with `redcap_entity_`. Example: given a `department` entity type, its db table is named as `redcap_entity_department`. Tables creation/removal is triggered via UI or via enabling/updating/disabling the module.

## 2. Defining entity types via `redcap_entity_types()` hook

### 2.1. Defining entity types

`redcap_entity_types()` is a new hook introduced by REDCap Entity, in which you can define your entity types. Each entity type should specify a key and a structured array. To define N entity types, your hook implementation should look like this:

```
<?php

function redcap_entity_types() {
    $types = [];

    $types[<ENTITY_TYPE_1_KEY>] = <ENTITY_TYPE_1_STRUCTURE>;
    $types[<ENTITY_TYPE_2_KEY>] = <ENTITY_TYPE_2_STRUCTURE>;
    (...)
    $types[<ENTITY_TYPE_N_KEY>] = <ENTITY_TYPE_N_STRUCTURE>;

    return $types;
}
```

The entity type key is the identifier of your entity type, and it should contain only alphanumeric characters and underscores (e.g. department_inventary). Its respective structure is an array that expects/accepts the following keys:

| Key                  | Required | Description   |
| -------------------- | -------- | ------------- |
| `label`              | Yes      | The entity type label. |
| `label_plural`       | No       | The plural entity type label. Defaults to "entities". |
| `icon`               | No       | The icon from REDCap repository that best describes your entity type. Defaults to "application\_view\_columns". |
| `properties`         | Yes      | Defines the properties / data structure of list of entity type. Each property is translated into a db table column - see __Defining entity properties__ section. |
| `special_keys`       | No       | Adds semantics to your properties (e.g. label, project ID) - see __Adding semantic to properties__ section.  |
| `class`              | No       | Allows developers to extend the default `Entity` class (analogous to the Model class in a MVC architecture), in order to add specific business logic. It's an array keyed as follows:<br><br>```['name' => <CLASS_NAME>, 'path' => <RELATIVE_PATH_TO_CLASS_FILE>]```<br><br>See more details on __Customizing entities behavior__ section. |
| `form_class`         | No       | Allows developers to extend the default `EntityForm` in order to customize elements of your add/edit entity form. It's an array that should follow the same structure of `class` setting. See more details on __Customizing entities lists__ section. |


Example:

```
<?php

function redcap_entity_types() {
    $types = [];

    $types['department'] = [
        'label' => 'Department',
        'label_plural' => 'Departments',
        'icon' => 'home_pencil',
        'properties' => [
            'name' => [
                'name' => 'Name',
                'type' => 'text',
                'required' => true,
            ],
            'institution' => [
                'name' => 'Institution',
                'type' => 'text',
                'choices' => [
                    'inst_1' => 'Institution 1',
                    'inst_2' => 'Institution 2',
                    'inst_3' => 'Institution 3',
                ],
                'choices_type' => 'radios',
                'required' => true,
            ],
            'project_id' => [
                'name' => 'Project ID',
                'type' => 'project',
                'required' => true,
            ],
            'contact_email' => [
                'name' => 'Contact email',
                'type' => 'email',
            ],
            'comments' => [
                'name' => 'Comments',
                'type' => 'long_text',
            ],
        ],
        'special_keys' => [
            'label' => 'label',
            'project' => 'project_id',
        ],
    ];

    return $types;
}
```

### 2.2. Defining entity properties

As you might have seen from the example above, properties are defined as follows:

```
<?php

(...)
    'properties' => [
        <PROPERTY_1_KEY> => <PROPERTY_1_STRUCTURE>,
        <PROPERTY_2_KEY> => <PROPERTY_2_STRUCTURE>,
        (...)
        <PROPERTY_N_KEY> => <PROPERTY_N_STRUCTURE>,
    ],
(...)
```

Each property structure is an array that allows the following keys:

| Key                | Required | Description   |
| ------------------ | -------- | ------------- |
| `name`             | Yes      | The property label. |
| `type`             | Yes      | The data type. Supported types: `text`, `integer`, `email`, `project`, `record`, `date`, `boolean`, `json`, `long_text`, `entity_reference`, `price`, `json`. |
| `required`         | No       | Boolean that defines whether the property on required on forms. Defaults to `false`. |
| `disabled`         | No       | Boolean that defines whether the property should be disabled on forms. Defaults to `false`. |
| `choices`          | No       | Set this field if your field should present a list of valid options. Expects an array of options labels, keyed by value. Example: `['option_1' => 'Option 1', 'option_2' => 'Option 2']` |
| `choices_callback` | No       | Same as `choices`, but instead of giving a fixed list of options, here you define a callable string which returns the options array. |
| `choices_type`     | No       | If `choices` or `choices callback` this setting defines the display mode of the selection options. Accepts "dropdown" and "radios". Defaults to "dropdown".|
| `prefix`           | No       | Sets a text prefix to a form field. |
| `entity_type`      | No       | Required only if type = `entity_reference` i.e. your property is referencing an entity. Sets the target entity type to be referenced. |


### 2.3. Adding semantics to properties

As shown on the previous example, `special_keys` can be used to add semantic to your properties. By doing that you are basically telling REDCap Entity what a particular field means. There are 2 types available:

- **label:** use this setting if a property of your entity represents the label (e.g. Name, Title, etc). If not set, REDCap Entity will use the internal (auto-incremented) ID as default.
- **project:** use this setting if your entities are project

Here is again the example.

```
<?php

function redcap_entity_types() {
(...)
        'special_keys' => [
            'label' => 'name',
            'project' => 'project_id',
        ],
(...)
}
```

Note that defining `special_keys` is not required, but it automates features on entity lists.

## 2. Creating DB tables

Implementing `hook_entity_types()` is not enough to enable your entity type. The next (and final) step is creating your entity db table. There are two available methods: via UI and programmatically.

### 3.1. Via UI

Go to **Control Center > Entity DB Manager**. Taking the Departments Manager module as our example, you should see the following list:

TODO: insert image

To create the db table, click on "create db table" button. To drop the table, click on "delete db table" and proceed with the confirmation form.

TODO: insert image

**Important:** During your design/dev process you can troubleshoot your `hook_entity_type()` definitions. If there is something wrong with your definition arrays, your entity type is listed as "Invalid", and you can see a list of pendencies to be addressed.

TODO: insert image

### 3.1. Programmatically (module enable)

This is very useful for skipping the manual creation via UI and instead trigger your table creation when your module gets enabled. To do that, you need to add the following code to your External Module base class:

```
<?php

function redcap_module_system_enable($version) {
    \REDCapEntity\EntityDB::buildSchema($this->PREFIX);
}
```

There are no errors or data loss if your module is enabled multiple times. However, if you want to reset your storage for every enable event, you can explicitly set it by adding a 2nd paremeter: `\REDCapEntity\EntityDB::buildSchema($this->PREFIX, true)`.
